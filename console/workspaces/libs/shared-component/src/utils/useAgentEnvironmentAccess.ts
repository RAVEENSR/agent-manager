 * Hook form of {@link evaluateAgentEnvironmentAccess}, bound to the current
 * token and to `orgName`'s environments.
 *
 * The target may be named instead of passed as an object. Turning a name into a
 * tier was the same useListEnvironments lookup at every call site, so it lives
 * here: a caller that already holds the environment passes it, and one that
 * holds only the name — a promotion target, a ?deployPanel link's environment —
 * passes that. The list is already in the query cache, since the Deploy page
 * fetches it to lay its cards out, so naming the environment costs no request.
 *
 * Returns a stable callback so a caller can evaluate several environments — the
 * promotion targets of one card, say — in a single render.
