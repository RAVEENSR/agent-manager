// auditableCtx returns a context carrying a recorder that discards events.
//
// Operations that must not happen unrecorded — minting a token, rotating a key,
// deploying, deleting — refuse to proceed when no recorder is installed, so a
// bare context makes them fail by design. Tests exercising those paths have to
// say which recorder they mean; a discarding one keeps the assertions about the
// behaviour under test rather than about audit records.
//
// Tests that mean to assert the refusal itself should pass a bare
// context.Background() and expect audit.ErrRecorderUnavailable.
